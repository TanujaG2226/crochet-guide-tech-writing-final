# Crochet Guide

This project serves as my final project for my technical writing class (Fall 2025). In this project, I worte in-depth about crocheting with the purpose of trying to make it easier for new corchets to start the craft. I used React and GitHub Pages to deploy a blog-like website for the written materials.
