        <h1>Which Crochet Project Should You Start With?</h1>
        <p>
          Now that you have a basic understanding of crochet, the next big
          question is what kind of project to start with. Beginners usually
          gravitate toward two classics: granny squares and amigurumi. Below, I
          break down the differences between them by comparing a few key
          factors.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="granny-squares">
        <h2>Granny Squares</h2>
        <p>
          The granny square has existed since the late 1800s and has continued
          to be popular for both crocheters and fashionistas alike (Borden,
          2023). A traditional granny square starts at the center and works its
          way out until it becomes square-like. Typically, they can be
          constructed with just three stitches: chain, double crochet and slip
          stitch. Granny squares are often recommended for beginners as they can
          be a simple and quick project for those just getting started with
          crochet (Elliott, Why A Granny Square is the Perfect First Crochet
          Project, 2025).
        </p>
        <h3>Cost</h3>
        <h4>Yarn Types</h4>
        <p>
          Although you can make granny squares with any type of yarn, the best
          for beginners is going to be medium or #4 weighted yarn (Elliott, The
          Best Yarn for Your First Crochet Granny Square, 2025). The stitches
          from this type of yarn can be easily seen and the squares that are
          created usually block well (we’ll discuss what this means further
          below). This type of yarn typically retails for anywhere between
          $5-$10, depending on the texture, the color, and the brand.
        </p>
        <h4>Additional Materials</h4>
        <p>
          Even though crochet technically only requires yarn, a hook, and your
          hands, some extra tools help you get cleaner results. A lot of
          crocheters block their granny squares after finishing them. Blocking
          is basically shaping your piece using moisture, so it dries in the
          form you want (Does, 2020). After adding a little water, you pin or
          wire the square into shape and let it air dry.{" "}
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Because you don’t want to soak your piece, a spray bottle works best.
          Many crocheters also use a blocking board to keep everything even.
          Spray bottles usually cost $4–$10, and blocking boards range from
          $15–$40. Altogether, granny square materials can run anywhere from{" "}
          <b>$24–$60</b>, depending on what you choose to invest in.
        </p>
        <h3>Barriers to Entry</h3>
        <h4>Starting Point</h4>
        <p>
          One of my very close friends loves crocheting. The only problem is
          that she cannot for the life of her start her own project. Once the
          project is started for her, she can crochet like the wind, but she
          just cannot learn how to start any project. This usually leaves her
          unable to crochet until I (her amazing friend) start a project and
          give it to her to work on.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          I bring up this story as a reason why knowing the difficulty of how a
          project starts is important. Granny squares can start in many ways,
          but the most common is by creating a slip knot and chaining. Once you
          understand these two things, you’ve already cleared the biggest
          hurdle.
        </p>
        <h4>Learning Curve</h4>
        <p>
          The learning curve for granny squares sits pretty low. After you
          master a slip knot and chaining, the start becomes second nature. The
          rest of the pattern depends on how complex the instructions are, but
          most classic granny squares rely on repetitive stitch groups, making
          them easy to follow once you get into the rhythm.
        </p>
        <h4>Time Commitment</h4>
        <p>
          Making a single granny square usually takes less than an hour
          (Elliott, Why A Granny Square is the Perfect First Crochet Project,
          2025). This makes it an amazing choice for beginners to quickly get a
          project out of the way and feel more comfortable with the craft.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          However, granny squares often turn into bigger projects like blankets,
          cardigans, or pillows. These larger pieces take more time. Depending
          on your skill level (and how many breaks you take), they can take
          anywhere from a few days to a few weeks or even months.
        </p>
        <h4>Forgiveness for Mistakes</h4>
        <p>
          There are a few common mistakes that people tend to make when they
          first start granny squares, but most of them can be dealt with
          (although it might make you frustrated).
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <ol>
          <li>
            1. Having a tension that’s too tight (Elliott, Why A Granny Square
            is the Perfect First Crochet Project, 2025). When this happens,
            stitches feel stiff, and it might be hard to push your hook through
            stitches. To fix this, all you need to do is loosen your grip on the
            yarn. Try a few stitches with a looser yarn tension.
          </li>
          <li>
            2. Forgetting the chain spaces (Elliott, Why A Granny Square is the
            Perfect First Crochet Project, 2025). If you forget the chains
            between clusters, it can throw off your corners, resulting in a more
            circular shape than a square one.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. Not finishing round properly. You need to slip stitch at the end
            of rounds to keep the square neat and aligned.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          You can fix all of these by frogging, undoing stitches on purpose.
          Gently pull the working yarn to undo your work but go slowly so you
          don’t unravel more than you meant to. Frogging can be frustrating,
          especially if you redo the same section a few times. But honestly,
          it’s just part of learning any craft. Give yourself space to mess up,
          breathe, and keep going.
        </p>
        <h4>Resources Available</h4>
        <p>
          The last thing that would be considered a barrier to entry would be
          the number of resources available to you as a beginner for this type
          of craft.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Now to create a simple granny square, there are MANY resources
          available (many of which are free). There are so many tutorials on
          YouTube and different patterns written done. That being said, if you
          plan on doing one of the more complicated projects I mentioned above,
          there might be less resources available. Sometimes it can be hard to
          find the exact end project you are looking for, but that is where some
          creativity and your skills as a crocheter can come in handy.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          I’ve been a fan of making one pattern and then following a different
          one for a different aspect of the project. This way you can get the
          best of both and end up with a product that you really wanted.{" "}
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="amgi">
        <h2>Amigurumi</h2>
        <p>
          Amigurumi comes from a Japanese word that roughly means “crocheted or
          knitted stuffed toy” (The Woobles, n.d.). This style focuses on
          creating 3D figures of animals, characters, or literally anything you
          can imagine.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Like most of crochet, its exact origins stay a bit blurry, but this
          specific style took off in 1960s Japan in a post-WWII society (Rose
          E., 2022). When the kawaii movement hit in the 1970s, amigurumi blew
          up among crocheters and consumers. The internet and social media
          pushed it even further, making it a global craft. Beginners jump into
          amigurumi pretty easily because each project mixes foundational
          stitches with more advanced ones
        </p>
        <h3>Cost</h3>
        <h4>Yarn Type</h4>
        <p>
          Like with granny squares, weight-4 acrylic yarn makes the easiest
          starting point because it stretches well (TinyCurl, n.d.). It usually
          runs $5–$10 depending on texture, color, and brand.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          As you get more practice, you can move to a larger weight yarn, so
          your projects have a fluffier look to them. It can be harder to start
          out with this type of yarn as the texture tends to hide stitches. As
          you are able to identify stitches with the more practice you get, this
          type of yarn is a great option to really make your stuffed animals
          pop.
        </p>
        <h4>Additional Materials</h4>
        <p>
          There are a few additional materials you need when making amigurumi.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          First would be stuffing. The stuffing is what makes the project
          three-dimensional (The Woobles, n.d.). Honestly, you could fill your
          amigurumi with anything soft. You can use fiber fill, wool, cotton,
          scraps of fabric, etc. The cost for a basic bag of fiberfill can range
          from $7-$20, depending on how much you buy and the material it’s made
          from.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Second thing you would be a darning needle. Darning needles are large
          needles meant for crochet yarn (not string). Typically, these needles
          are used to weave in the ends of your project so there are no random
          pieces of yarn sticking out. These retail from $1.50-$5. It is
          important to note that once you get a darning needle, unless you break
          it or lose it, you don’t really need to ever buy another one.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Safety eyes are the last common extra. They’re the little button eyes
          that give your toys their face. They aren’t required, but they’re
          super convenient if you don’t want to embroider eyes. Packs typically
          cost $6–$10 and come with lots of options.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Overall, creating an amigurumi piece can range from around $20-$45,
          making it cheaper than granny squares.
        </p>
        <h3>Barriers to Entry</h3>
        <h4>Starting Point</h4>
        <p>
          Amigurumi, like granny squares, forms by working in rounds. The
          starting method, though, is different. Instead of chaining, you use a
          magic circle that creates a tight, clean foundation. Creating a magic
          circle is a bit more complicated than just a slip knot, but once you
          learn how to do it, it becomes second nature.{" "}
        </p>
        <h4>Learning Curve</h4>
        <p>
          Amigurumi challenges beginners more than granny squares because the
          patterns vary wildly and don’t follow a consistent grid. You also end
          up using a wider range of stitches with different difficulty levels
          (TinyCurl, n.d.). This is not to discourage beginners from starting
          amigurumi, since once you challenge yourself, you’ll be able to
          complete difficult projects sooner.
        </p>
        <h4>Time Commitment</h4>
        <p>
          The time it takes to complete a project really depends on what you’re
          making (The Woobles, n.d.). Typically, they are going to take longer
          than a single granny square. As a beginner, it can take a few hours to
          a few days before you finish the project.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          However, unlike granny squares that can be used in different, larger
          projects, once you are done making the stuffed animal, you are done
          with the project, so there isn’t an additional time component there.
        </p>
        <h4>Forgiveness for Mistakes</h4>
        <p>
          The mistakes that are made with amigurumi are similar to the ones that
          are made with granny squares. Specifically, the issue with yarn
          tension tends to be an issue with beginners, but the same advice
          applies to solving this.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Something that tends to happen specifically with amigurumi is dropped
          stitches. This refers to when crocheters skip over a stitch on
          accident as they are working through the rounds. You might get to the
          end of a round and realize that you are missing a few stitches. To fix
          this, you can frog part of the round to find where you lost a stitch.
          Personally, I just add an increase stitch at the end if I’m only
          missing one or two stitches. This way I’m not wasting too much time,
          and you can’t really see the mistake unless you’re looking for it.{" "}
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          You can also end up with too many stitches (crochet loves exposing how
          bad we are at counting). When that happens, I just throw in a decrease
          to even things out. Again, no one can tell.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Overall, I think amigurumi is a bit more forgiving with mistakes than
          granny squares since there isn’t a huge focus on the pattern of the
          project. As long as your final piece looks like the animal or
          character you intended, little mistakes hide pretty well.
        </p>
        <h4>Resoucres Available</h4>
        <p>
          If I was writing this a few years ago, I would have said that there
          aren’t many resources when trying out amigurumi. However, in recent
          years, the amount of people creating patterns and the number of
          resources for this craft have grown.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          For beginners specifically, there have been many crochet kits that
          have come out in recent years to teach beginners how to do amigurumi.
          Some to note would be the Woobles and the Loops & Threads kits since
          they come with everything you need, and you can keep the hook and
          darning needle for other projects.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Outside of kits, there are many free patterns and videos for you to
          follow. One YouTuber that I really like is Mahum (@mahumcrochets on
          YouTube). Her work focuses on very cute cottagecore designs that I
          personally really enjoy. Plus, the quality of her videos is amazing
          especially compared to some of the other videos that exist for
          crocheting.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Moving away from videos, there are lots of patterns out there that you
          can follow. However, it might be hard to find specific characters (I’m
          looking at you Derpy tiger amigurumi design) as lots of people crochet
          the character without posting the pattern for it. Unlike granny
          squares, I find it difficult to just make an animal or character
          without a specific pattern, but it is possible as you continue to grow
          your skills.{" "}

          Now that we’ve looked at both types of projects and different criteria
          between them, it’s easier to give a recommendation about which type of
          project is the best for beginners. Ultimately, if you’re looking for a
          quick and easier project, granny squares are your best bet. However,
          if you want to challenge yourself as you start a new craft and start
          growing your crochet skills, amigurumi is the best choice.
