      <p>
        My name is Tanuja Gunapooti. I am currently a senior at WashU studing
        Business and Computer Science. I have been a crafter all my life (I
        always liked to say my favorite activities are ones with my hands). I
        got into crocheting the summer of 2023 and haven't stopped since. I
        wouldn't consider myself an expert at it but crocheting is something I'm
        super passionate about.

        As I mentioned in the introduction, I really hope that people who start
        crocheting feel comfortable enough to start any craft, just as I have.
        As I crocheted more and more, I realized that there were many crafts
        that I haven't engaged in. Through my friends, I started embroidering
        and bead embroidery in my free time. Recently, I've started bedazzling
        different items for myself and friends. Crafting is so much fun and a
        great way to spend time reflecting.
